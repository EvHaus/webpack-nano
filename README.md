# webpack-nano

A teensy, squeaky üê§ clean Webpack CLI

`webpack-nano` operates on the assumption and premise that all options for configuring a webpack build are set via a [config file](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/). It offers minimal command line options for modifying a build.

## Install

Using npm:

```console
npm install webpack-nano --save-dev
```

## Requirements

`webpack-nano` is an evergreen module. üå≤ This module requires Node v10.11.0+.

## Benefits

- Holy bananas üçå it's itsy bitsy
- It does one thing: tells webpack to build a config
- OK, so two things: can also [watch for changes](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/watch/) in build files
- Doesn't hit you over the head with an avalanche of flags and options
- ~90% smaller than webpack-cli and webpack-command

## Usage

```console
$ npx wp --help

  Usage
    $ wp [...options]

  Options
    --config          A path to a webpack config file
    --config.{name}   A path to a webpack config file, and the config name to run
    --help            Displays this message
    --silent          Instruct the CLI to produce no console output
    --version         Displays webpack-nano and webpack versions

  Examples
    $ wp
    $ wp --help
    $ wp --config webpack.config.js
    $ wp --config.serve webpack.config.js
```
